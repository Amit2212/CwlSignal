// Simple thread safety:
//  1. No client "work" (functions or closures) should be invoked inside a private dispatch_queue/lock
//  2. No client supplied data should be released inside a private dispatch_queue/lock
// To facilitate this requirement, "lock internal" methods can return DeferredWork. DeferredWork values must be passed up the stack until they can be invoked outside any dispatch_queue.
//
// To ensure that DeferredWork is not simply forgotten without running, at debug time it includes an OnDelete check that raises a precondition failure if the DeferredWork has not been run.
